## Dev history
I have worked for the [Ministry of Justice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice) since 1992 starting as a plain civil servant and then starting to write code to simplify the repetitive jobs I needed to do.
I 'became' a full time developer around 1999 and since then have moved from WordBasic -> VBA -> VB6 -> C# -> Ruby
In that time I have written too many solutions to remember, using a variety of languages and a plethora of data storage solutions
